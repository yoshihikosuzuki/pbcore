# pbcore [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/PacificBiosciences/pbcore.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/PacificBiosciences/pbcore)

The `pbcore` package provides Python APIs for interacting with PacBio
data files and writing bioinformatics applications.

## Installation:

    % pip install -r requirements.txt
    % python setup.py install

Note that h5py is now considered an "optional" dependency, since the old
RSII sequencing files are no longer generated by current systems and
software.  The underlying functionality has been left in place for backwards
compatibility with existing code, but you will need to install h5py manually
to use these parts of the API:

    % pip install h5py
